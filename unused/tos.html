    <h1>RyanGreenBlue's Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>
      It is your (hereinafter, the Client's) responsibility to read and understand the
      following terms and conditions before making an order on this website
      (ryangreenblue.glitch.me/comms.html).
      Client also agrees, without limitation or qualification, 
      to be bound by and to comply with these Terms and Conditions.
      All clients must submit through the Google Form linked in the COMMISSIONS section of the website.
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <!-- TEMPLATE !-->
    <h2>PAYMENT.</h2>
    <p>
      Payment in full is required before I (RyanGreenBlue) begin any work on Client’s material.
      These can be done through PayPal invoices which I will send to Client, or a Bank e-transfer invoice (only if you live in Canada). <br /><br />
    </p>

    <!-- TEMPLATE !-->

    <h2>PRIVATE vs COMMERCIAL Projects.</h2>
    <p>Private projects, like projects (mixing, mastering, production) 
      for Client's albums, singles, etc. 
      to be posted on Music Distributors can be ordered through
      the commission form.
    Commercial projects, like advertisements,
      synchronization work (video game soundtracks, film soundtracks, etc.)
    need to be disclosed in emails and cannot be ordered through the commission form.<br /><br /></p>
    

    <h2>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</h2><p>
    RyanGreenBlue shall not be liable under any circumstances
    for any incidental or consequential loss or damages,
    including but not limited to loss of profits,
    and the Client expressly waives any and all claims
    for any such loss or damages.
    Under no circumstances shall RyanGreenBlue’s liability exceed,
    nor shall Client’s available remedies extend beyond
    return of the full fees or charges paid for any services provided by RyanGreenBlue.
    </p>

    <h2>REFUND POLICY.</h2>
    <p>
    After the initial payment has been made, no refunds are possible.
    </p>

    <h2>REVISIONS.</h2>
    <p>
      As I work, I will send .mp3 updates to the Client. This is the best time for feedback!
      Client will get 1 revision.
      What IS covered by a revision: You’d like the volume
      of an instrument and/or vocal adjusted. You’d like effects adjusted (i.e.
      more reverb, less delay) What is NOT covered by a revision: Does
      not include arrangement changes: Things like creating drops, stop effects
      and mutes.
      Any additional revisions will incur an extra fee.
    </p>
