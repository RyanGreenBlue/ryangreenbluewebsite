    <h1>RyanGreenBlue's Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>
      All clients must submit through the Google Form linked in the COMMISSIONS section of the website.
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <!-- TEMPLATE !-->
    <h2>PAYMENT.</h2>
    <p>
      Payment in full is required before I begin any work on Client’s material.
      These will be done through PayPal invoices which I will send to Client. <br /><br />
    </p>

    <!-- TEMPLATE !-->

    <h2>PRIVATE vs COMMERCIAL Projects.</h2>
    <p>Private projects, like projects (mixing, mastering, production) 
      for Client's albums, singles, etc. 
      to be posted on Music Distributors can be ordered through
      the commission form.
    Commercial projects, like advertisements,
      synchronization work (video game soundtracks, film soundtracks, etc.)
    need to be disclosed in emails and cannot be ordered through the commission form.<br /><br /></p>
    

    <h2>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</h2><p>
    RyanGreenBlue shall not be liable under any circumstances
    for any incidental or consequential loss or damages,
    including but not limited to loss of profits,
    and the Client expressly waives any and all claims
    for any such loss or damages.
    Under no circumstances shall RyanGreenBlue’s liability exceed,
    nor shall Client’s available remedies extend beyond
    return of the full fees or charges paid for any services provided by RyanGreenBlue.
    </p>

    <h2>REFUND POLICY.</h2>
    <p>
    
    </p>

    <h2>REVISIONS.</h2>
    <p>
      Client will get two Revisions.
      What IS covered by a revision: You’d like the volume
      of an instrument and/or vocal adjusted. You’d like effects adjusted (i.e.
      more reverb, less delay) What is NOT covered by a revision: Does
      not include arrangement changes: Things like creating drops, stop effects
      and mutes.
      As I work, I will send updates in .mp3, this is the best time for feedback!
      Any extra revisions will cost an extra fee.
