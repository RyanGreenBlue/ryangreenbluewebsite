VERSE 1:
	Bm	     F#    Gmaj7 		    Edim
	You said you liked dancing in the rain with me
	Bm	               F#               Gmaj7 		  F#7
	Now I've gotten wiser, darling, and I'd rather be dancing alone
	Bm	                F#           Gmaj7 		    Edim
	Decided I had ended too quickly, and what were you supposed to do?
	Bm	                        F#        Gmaj7    F#7
	Hide the fact you'd rather I be dead than anything without

				 Bm  	A7
	You look so different in red 		(different in red)

VERSE 2:
	Bm                        F#            Gmaj7                Edim
	You went around the world placing every inch of the blame on me
	Bm                     F#        Gmaj7                  N.C.
	Letting all your words drown me, rather than letting me be
	Bm                           F#              Gmaj7                      Edim
	After all the world believed you, they don't know what you look like in red
	Bm                                Gmaj7                 Edim
	And when they went and left me, I bet you were happy to hear what they said:

	G#min                  F#7
	They called me a liar, I called it my word
		G#sus4/E	    F#			  Emaj7no3
	They'll all join the choir, proclaim what they've heard
		Emaj7#11 	     F#
	They'll tear me to pieces as life starts to whirl
  		Bmin		      Dbm7b5
	They've made me a monster all over a girl

	So dance, my darling, the rain's turning red
	    Dmin                         Em7b5 Dbdim7
	The world will all know what you said
	Dmin			  C#dim/G# 			A7add6
	You can scream to the heavens that you're never wrong
	N.C.
	Great God himself will come sing along

CHOIR:
	(spoken, over choir)

	Reality's doors are thrust open

	As your lies crash down upon you

	Tell the world I'm your killer 

	While you prepare me for the slaughter


	Suffocate me under some weight you think is love 

	And beg for a bookend as if you deserve it

	You think I need you? Here's your bookend, darling:

	I hope you hate me
